# android-nfc-clock

Simple Android application to demonstrate NFC hardware card emulation (HCE) functionality.

## Description

This is a simple Android application to demonstrate NFC hardware card emulation (HCE) functionality. It does so by using Android's HCE functionality to make the device "broadcast" itself as a new NFC NDEF tag, containing the current date and time, every second.

Does that sound absurd? It should, because it is. This application is meant to serve as a reference implementation and template for more sophisticated applications that want to use Android's NFC/HCE functionality.
